    <h3>How to use this guide</h3>
     <p>This resource page is a collection of links to other organisations that are working in the queer justice space or may be able to offer you support. If engaging with this research project has inspired you to learn more or take some action for yourself or others, this page is a great place to start.</p>
     <br>
     <p>The list on this page focuses on justice oriented and support services. However, there are many other organisations working to support our communities. If you are looking for more examples, maybe check out this ABC Article: <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-06/queer-and-lgbtqia-plus-support-services-in-australia/12115292" target="_blank">Queer and LGBTQIA+ community support services in Australia</a>. If you have a suggestion about another service or resource that should be linked here, please include it in a submission, or get in touch with the research team at our contact page. </p>
