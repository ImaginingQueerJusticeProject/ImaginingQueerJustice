Title: It is about community
Date: 12/01/2026
Category: Imaginaries
Tags: Collective justice, Community, Intersectionality, Rights
Content: Queer justice is about fixing the systems that make queer people unsafe or worn down, not just giving a few of us rights and calling it a day. It is not only about laws or visibility, but about being able to live a normal, decent life without always having to explain yourself or fight to be respected. <br> It means recognising that not all queer people have the same experience. Justice has to include people who are also marginalised in other ways, like by race, class, disability, body size, gender expression or being neurodivergent. If things only work for the most privileged queer people, then it is not really justice. <br> Queer justice is collective. It is about community, care and looking out for each other, not just individual success stories. It values things like chosen family, mutual aid and support, not just policy changes. <br> And it is not about being acceptable to straight society. It leaves room for anger, joy, grief and difference. It is about being able to exist fully and safely, as you are. <br> Basically, queer justice is not about fitting in. It is about changing things so everyone can live well.

Category: Futures
Tags: Collective justice, Community, Intersectionality, Safety
Content: A just future is one where people’s basic needs are met without having to prove their worth. Housing, healthcare, safety, rest and community are normal, not things you have to fight for. <br> It is a future where queer people can live openly and safely, but also where justice is not limited to identity alone. It looks at the whole picture, including climate, work, disability, migration, class and care. No one is left carrying the cost of systems that do harm. <br> A just future values care over profit. It recognises unpaid labour, emotional labour and community work as real work. It makes space for different bodies, minds and ways of living, instead of forcing everyone to fit one narrow idea of productivity or success. <br> It is collective, not individual. Progress is measured by how the most marginalised people are doing, not by how comfortable the most privileged feel. <br> Most of all, a just future feels liveable. People have time to rest, make art, be in nature, build relationships and feel joy. Justice is not only about survival. It is about being able to live well.

Title: A very big question
Date: 14/10/2025
Category: Imaginaries
Tags: Access and inclusion, Discrimination, Equality, Freedom, Intersectionality, Law and the courts, Safety, The state
Content: This is a very big question! <br> The first thing that comes to mind for me is access to legal processes, and especially the need for queer people to have access to legal services that are free, safe and competent in working with queer people. <br> But then I reflect that access to legal processes will only go so far if the law itself remains unjust. <br> So the second thing that comes to mind for me is laws that are just for queer people. This must include laws that reflect an understanding of the lived experience of queer people, including the reality of living as a queer person within an often queerphobic society. <br> But then I reflect on the broader changes that would be required in order to produce just laws for queer people, and also the fact that just laws for queer people would need to drive broader change in society, politics and culture. <br> So this brings me to answer along the lines that queer justice is a social reality where people are free to be queer and queer people are free to live as their authentic selves, with meaningful community and with equality, safety and inclusion. <br> But I imagine that many people would find an answer like that to be frustratingly vague. So I think there is value in speaking to both the general concept (freedom, equality, safety, inclusion, etc.) and specific examples (I have focused on law, but I might also say health, housing, etc.). <br>

Category: Futures
Tags: Access and inclusion, Equality, Freedom, Intersectionality
Content: From my perspective, a just future might look like a future in which queer people and queerness are so normalised that there is no need to think much about queer justice - a future in which queer justice is boring, not because it isn’t important, but because it is so ordinary as to not call for much thought. <br> I would like to be clear that I am not imagining a future in which queer people have assimilated into the existing norms. The future I am imagining has both unprecedented diversity and unprecedented respect for diversity. The point is that nobody is losing sleep over queerness, as no-one is queerphobic anymore and queer people are free to get on with their lives.

Title: Fully automated luxury gay space communism

Category: Futures
Tags: Systems, Health, Equality, Community, Intersectionality
Content: fylly automated luxury gay space communism. Jokes but I do think that a just future first and foremost has to mean we stop harming the planet and get rid of our economic independence on war mongering (ie militarisation of universities). We would listen to First Nations people and communities and being just would mean finding protections for Country and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sovereignty. I do believe we'd be vegan to be more just to all species but it could be a good life with a lot of music and the arts in general. Everyone could have a 3 days a week necessary job (like growing food or being a nurse or teacher etc) and an optional 1-2 day a week awesome job (something creative, or civically minded or satisfying in some other way, can even still be your normal job but doing it with a lot of choice and autonomy and innovating as you like) and then 2 days a week for rest. Leadership would be job-shared and a lot more grass-roots and local. Accountability would be downward and outward not upward to a surveilling centre. Every building would be wheelchair friendly and all disabilities would be catered for - there would be a constant desire to make design of places and groups better for people. Naps would be normalised. Oh did I mention families? Two-parent families would not be the norm...more like six...I mean I guess you'd be allowed to have fewer parents but for kids its better to have more. The adults in the family would likely be a polycule but the details of that are negotiable because you don't need rules so long as consent and honesty are prioritised. Each person would have one kid (for sustainability) but someone who doesn't want to parent or whatever could give that right/duty to someone else who wants more than one. Resources are distributed by need (yeah I know I sound like I am trying to be marx now). I actually wrote a story about a future like this. Work done within the family counts as work. Between the 6 adults they'd work out who does what but people with physical labouring jobs get out of cooking and cleaning more but still read to the kids or whatever. And people who work with their mind all day get out of having to help kids with homework or whatever but still have to maintain the home...so everyone gets balance. But also if someone is disabled and can't do stuff they are just cared for/with as well.

Title: The humanity we deserve

Category: Futures
Tags: Queer justice, Intersectionality, Systems, Law and the courts
Content: I balance the fine line of wanting to integrate queer and disability justice into a future that is slow and incremental, because the gears of change are under the pressure of a capitalist society that supports hetero, cisnormative ways of doing. Radical change would be having to break all the rules, re-create everything to a queer vision (community, platonic love, chosen family as legally supported, free access to gender affirming healthcare, queer sex education, with organisatons being ran by and for queer people, alternatives to the criminal processing system for everyone who needs it). The vision is very out of reach. But justice - a word that means something different for everyone - to me, at least, means giving queer people the humanity we deserve, opportunities and freedom. In terms of legal justice - these all intersect. I cannot have faith in the medical system if they only consider my sex. I cannot feel protected by the state if they refuse to recognise my gender or diverse relationships. The future of justice for queer people includes our intersecting identities (class, disability, race, ethnic heritage, customs and culture). I cannot advocate queer justice on behalf of any other queer person, which is why it is so hard. cis/het/white people have a base to work with, they have shared interests, but queer justice means justice and liberation for all of our identities. Sorry for the rant...

A more just future would require us to stop out-sourcing our ideas of justice to the State, which consistently fails to deliver it, and start practicing it in the everyday.

When being queer is as normal as being tall or having brown eyes. I think a just future involves an understanding of our past, and holding people to account for their actions and words. I don't necessarily think justice in this way needs to mete by the courts (though where necessary it should be). Justice can be enacted by communities by speaking out against those who use hateful language, but also educating them and building community. A just future is as much about connection and respect, as it is about recognition, and changing the status quo.

Content: "Kaleidoscopic justice is justice as a constantly shifting pattern, continually refracted through new experiences and perspectives, with multiple beginnings and no finite ending. Justice as a pluralistic, lived, evolving experience. Embedded within this approach are various justice themes – consequences, recognition, dignity, voice, prevention and connectedness – which embody and exemplify the constantly changing pattern of kaleidoscopic justice." <br> - Clare McGlynn & Nicole Westmarland, Kaleidoscopic Justice: Sexual Violence and Victim-Survivors’ Perceptions of Justice
