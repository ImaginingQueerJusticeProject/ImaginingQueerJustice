Title: Future Justice
Date: 2024-11-10
Category: Researcher Posts
Tags: Queer quotes, Queer identity, Futurity
Content: "Queerness is not yet here. Queerness is an ideality. Put another way, we are not yet queer. We may never touch queerness, but we can feel  it as the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality. We have never been queer, yet queerness exists for us as an ideality that can be distilled from the past and used to imagine a future. The future is queerness’s domain." <br> - José Esteban Muñoz, Cruising Utopia

Title: Kaleidescopic Justice
Date: 2025-01-15
Category: Researcher Posts
Tags: Queer quotes, Justice
Content: "Kaleidoscopic justice is justice as a constantly shifting pattern, continually refracted through new experiences and perspectives, with multiple beginnings and no finite ending. Justice as a pluralistic, lived, evolving experience. Embedded within this approach are various justice themes – consequences, recognition, dignity, voice, prevention and connectedness – which embody and exemplify the constantly changing pattern of kaleidoscopic justice." <br> - Clare McGlynn & Nicole Westmarland, Kaleidoscopic Justice: Sexual Violence and Victim-Survivors’ Perceptions of Justice
