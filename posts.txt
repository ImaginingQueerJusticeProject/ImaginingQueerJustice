Title: Future Justice

Tags: Queer identity, Futurity
Content: QUEERNESS IS NOT yet here. Queerness is an ideality. Put another way, we are not yet queer. We may never touch queerness, but we can feel  it as the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality.

The future is queerness’s domain. - José Esteban Muñoz, Cruising Utopia
