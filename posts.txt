Title: Fully automated luxury gay space communism  
Date: 26/09/2025
Category: Futures
Tags: Systems, Health, Equality, Community, Intersectionality
Content: fylly automated luxury gay space communism. Jokes but I do think that a just future first and foremost has to mean we stop harming the planet and get rid of our economic independence on war mongering (ie militarisation of universities). We would listen to First Nations people and communities and being just would mean finding protections for Country and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sovereignty. I do believe we'd be vegan to be more just to all species but it could be a good life with a lot of music and the arts in general. Everyone could have a 3 days a week necessary job (like growing food or being a nurse or teacher etc) and an optional 1-2 day a week awesome job (something creative, or civically minded or satisfying in some other way, can even still be your normal job but doing it with a lot of choice and autonomy and innovating as you like) and then 2 days a week for rest. Leadership would be job-shared and a lot more grass-roots and local. Accountability would be downward and outward not upward to a surveilling centre. Every building would be wheelchair friendly and all disabilities would be catered for - there would be a constant desire to make design of places and groups better for people. Naps would be normalised. Oh did I mention families? Two-parent families would not be the norm...more like six...I mean I guess you'd be allowed to have fewer parents but for kids its better to have more. The adults in the family would likely be a polycule but the details of that are negotiable because you don't need rules so long as consent and honesty are prioritised. Each person would have one kid (for sustainability) but someone who doesn't want to parent or whatever could give that right/duty to someone else who wants more than one. Resources are distributed by need (yeah I know I sound like I am trying to be marx now). I actually wrote a story about a future like this. Work done within the family counts as work. Between the 6 adults they'd work out who does what but people with physical labouring jobs get out of cooking and cleaning more but still read to the kids or whatever. And people who work with their mind all day get out of having to help kids with homework or whatever but still have to maintain the home...so everyone gets balance. But also if someone is disabled and can't do stuff they are just cared for/with as well.

Tags: Intersectionality, Systems, Law and the courts, Health, Equality
Content: This is like asking us to describe the universe! But some things are particularly essential to a just future for queer people. That includes equitable healthcare provision (which means much, much more inclusive health research and a major reform of medical education), marriage and family law, and political representation and visibility of queer people who advocate inclusively for diverse queer communities, especially those at major intersections - disability, religious diaspora, Black, Indigenous - where representatives are often forced to choose between advocating for one "identity" and another.

Title: The humanity we deserve
Date: 24/09/2025
Category: Futures
Tags: Queer justice, Intersectionality, Systems, Law and the courts
Content: I balance the fine line of wanting to integrate queer and disability justice into a future that is slow and incremental, because the gears of change are under the pressure of a capitalist society that supports hetero, cisnormative ways of doing. Radical change would be having to break all the rules, re-create everything to a queer vision (community, platonic love, chosen family as legally supported, free access to gender affirming healthcare, queer sex education, with organisatons being ran by and for queer people, alternatives to the criminal processing system for everyone who needs it). The vision is very out of reach. But justice - a word that means something different for everyone - to me, at least, means giving queer people the humanity we deserve, opportunities and freedom. In terms of legal justice - these all intersect. I cannot have faith in the medical system if they only consider my sex. I cannot feel protected by the state if they refuse to recognise my gender or diverse relationships. The future of justice for queer people includes our intersecting identities (class, disability, race, ethnic heritage, customs and culture). I cannot advocate queer justice on behalf of any other queer person, which is why it is so hard. cis/het/white people have a base to work with, they have shared interests, but queer justice means justice and liberation for all of our identities. Sorry for the rant...

Content: Easy name and gender change, clearly defined definitions of gender identities, including an ambiguous term for those who have made up a new name that will probably go out of fashion but it will affirm their gender at the time they do their forms (usually in the non-binary family as many don’t grasp the concept of what that word/term means. Added to that, ease of access to gender affirming care under supervision of assigned professionals so as to avoid 1) misinformation, 2) malpractice, 3) inconsistency of care. And of course better education on what it means to be in the trans umbrella, understanding hormone therapy and blockers, understanding surgery outcomes, & how not to be a jerk to someone who is trans.

Content: I think justice - actual justice - IS queer. It requires accepting multiplicities, engagement with the fact that none of us are one thing, all of us use and experience harm at different points. Justice is a collective process, not something that can be dictated, and is contingent on people in that process being able to see that identity is fluid and people can and do change in relationship with each other

Content: I'm not sure I think of justice as something to be attained. I imagine working collectively on getting better at DOING justice in the everyday, and that a future that is more just than the present would be one where more people have the skills to reflect critically, repair harm, and build more equitable systems. A more just future would require us to stop out-sourcing our ideas of justice to the State, which consistently fails to deliver it, and start practicing it in the everyday. I see snatches of this way of being in my life, in tiny spaces and interactions, and these are the same spaces that are the only ones I truly feel safe.

Tags: Community, Law and the courts
Content: A just future in my mind looks just for everyone, or as just as can be. It's when two people can hold hands outside without thinking about what people may think. When being queer is as normal as being tall or having brown eyes. I think a just future involves an understanding of our past, and holding people to account for their actions and words. I don't necessarily think justice in this way needs to mete by the courts (though where necessary it should be). Justice can be enacted by communities by speaking out against those who use hateful language, but also educating them and building community. A just future is as much about connection and respect, as it is about recognition, and changing the status quo.
