Title: Conceptualised from the start
Date: 25/08/2025
Category: Imaginaries
Tags: Systems, Inclusion, Access
Content: Queer justice is a justice system built with queer people conceptualised from the start, as well as other marginalised peoples, rather than their inclusion being built on amendments and after thoughts. This allows equitable access to justice.

Tags: State, Violence, Police
Content: A just future to me looks to the dismantling of police and prisons, utilising a system that does not require the use of state sanctioned violence. This state violence often manifests in the oppression of marginalised communities and along lines of governmental biases

Content: Get rid of that religious discrimination bill bullshit. No organisation should be allowed to discriminate on the basis of gender identity or sexuality. Especially none receiving government money (ahem- private schools, private hospitals)  Except in cases of 'positive discrimination' (e.g. a female or LGBTQIA identified position because of a genuine occupatinal demand requiring lived experience etc) <br>Apologies and restitution to members of the LGBTQIA community who have in the past or are still ongoingly experiencing discrimination in their place of work or from organisations such as the Police. <br>Free, widely available sexual health education and health services.

Title: Actual Justice - IS Queer
Date: 22/08/2025
Category: Imaginaries
Tags: Collective Justice, Identity, Acceptance, Harm
Content: I think justice - actual justice - IS queer. It requires accepting multiplicities, engagement with the fact that none of us are one thing, all of us use and experience harm at different points. Justice is a collective process, not something that can be dictated, and is contingent on people in that process being able to see that identity is fluid and people can and do change in relationship with each other

Title: DOING Justice in the Everyday
Date: 22/08/2025
Category: Futures
Tags: Collective Justice, Harm, Systems, State
Content: I'm not sure I think of justice as something to be attained. I imagine working collectively on getting better at DOING justice in the everyday, and that a future that is more just than the present would be one where more people have the skills to reflect critically, repair harm, and build more equitable systems. A more just future would require us to stop out-sourcing our ideas of justice to the State, which consistently fails to deliver it, and start practicing it in the everyday. I see snatches of this way of being in my life, in tiny spaces and interactions, and these are the same spaces that are the only ones I truly feel safe.

Title: A Tool/ A Lens

Category: Imaginaries
Tags: Justice, Queer History, Acknowledgment, Authority
Content: I'm not too sure. Perhaps justice for our historical mistreatment, and also the mistreatment we still face. It's an acknowledgement of the history, and the current barriers posed by the status quo. A tool to question authority and lens through which to understand politics and society.

Title: Just for Everyone
Date: 28/07/2025
Category: Futures
Tags: Justice, Futurity, Community, Courts
Content: A just future in my mind looks just for everyone, or as just as can be. It's when two people can hold hands outside without thinking about what people may think. When being queer is as normal as being tall or having brown eyes. I think a just future involves an understanding of our past, and holding people to account for their actions and words. I don't necessarily think justice in this way needs to mete by the courts (though where necessary it should be). Justice can be enacted by communities by speaking out against those who use hateful language, but also educating them and building community. A just future is as much about connection and respect, as it is about recognition, and changing the status quo.

Content: "Queerness is not yet here. Queerness is an ideality. Put another way, we are not yet queer. We may never touch queerness, but we can feel  it as the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality. We have never been queer, yet queerness exists for us as an ideality that can be distilled from the past and used to imagine a future. The future is queerness’s domain." <br> - José Esteban Muñoz, Cruising Utopia

Title: Kaleidescopic Justice
Date: 2025-01-15
Category: Researcher Posts
Tags: Queer quotes
Content: "Kaleidoscopic justice is justice as a constantly shifting pattern, continually refracted through new experiences and perspectives, with multiple beginnings and no finite ending. Justice as a pluralistic, lived, evolving experience. Embedded within this approach are various justice themes – consequences, recognition, dignity, voice, prevention and connectedness – which embody and exemplify the constantly changing pattern of kaleidoscopic justice." <br> - Clare McGlynn & Nicole Westmarland, Kaleidoscopic Justice: Sexual Violence and Victim-Survivors’ Perceptions of Justice
