Title: A Tool/ A Lens 
Date: 28/07/2025
Category: Imaginaries
Tags: Justice, Queer History, Acknowledgment, Authority
Content: I'm not too sure. Perhaps justice for our historical mistreatment, and also the mistreatment we still face. It's an acknowledgement of the history, and the current barriers posed by the status quo. A tool to question authority and lens through which to understand politics and society.

Title: Just for Everyone
Date: 28/07/2025
Category: Futures
Tags: Justice, Futurity, Community, Courts
Content: A just future in my mind looks just for everyone, or as just as can be. It's when two people can hold hands outside without thinking about what people may think. When being queer is as normal as being tall or having brown eyes. I think a just future involves an understanding of our past, and holding people to account for their actions and words. I don't necessarily think justice in this way needs to mete by the courts (though where necessary it should be). Justice can be enacted by communities by speaking out against those who use hateful language, but also educating them and building community. A just future is as much about connection and respect, as it is about recognition, and changing the status quo.

Tags: Queer quotes, Queer Identity, Futurity
Content: "Queerness is not yet here. Queerness is an ideality. Put another way, we are not yet queer. We may never touch queerness, but we can feel  it as the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality. We have never been queer, yet queerness exists for us as an ideality that can be distilled from the past and used to imagine a future. The future is queerness’s domain." <br> - José Esteban Muñoz, Cruising Utopia

Content: "We have been thinking through risk forever: how to face gendered violence, structural racism, contagion, the violence of poverty, the ravages of the dominant culture that tries time and again to disappear us. We have laid the groundwork, dug the foundation. And we do not have to do it alone: we save each other’s lives, back and forth, always." <br> - Shira Hassan, Saving Our Own Lives: A Liberatory Practice of Harm Reduction

Title: Kaleidescopic Justice
Date: 2025-01-15
Category: Researcher Posts
Tags: Queer quotes, Justice, Recognition
Content: "Kaleidoscopic justice is justice as a constantly shifting pattern, continually refracted through new experiences and perspectives, with multiple beginnings and no finite ending. Justice as a pluralistic, lived, evolving experience. Embedded within this approach are various justice themes – consequences, recognition, dignity, voice, prevention and connectedness – which embody and exemplify the constantly changing pattern of kaleidoscopic justice." <br> - Clare McGlynn & Nicole Westmarland, Kaleidoscopic Justice: Sexual Violence and Victim-Survivors’ Perceptions of Justice
